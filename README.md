## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google APIs

### What I learned


I learned a lot from just one single project like this. It's really different when you do it on project and when you just sitting there and watch video tutorial. Nothing cant beat experience more than theory. 

This is my first project after I learned video tutorial. Yeah, so many syntax that I forget after watching tutorial. If it was not implement directly to project it become useless and can't remembered a thing that you watch.
